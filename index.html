        The analysts at TIOBE agree, writing in their June 2019 index, “If Python can keep this pace, it will probably replace C and Java in 3 to 4 years' time, thus becoming the most popular programming language of the world.” The reason, the analysts said, is that software engineering is a rapidly growing field, and Python
        Computer programming jobs may be declining, but coding is becoming the most in-demand skill across industries. Apart from companies in the technology sector, there are an increasing number of businesses relying on computer code.
        If you're just interested in programming and want to dip your feet in without going all the way, learn Python for its easier to learn syntax. If you plan to pursue computer science/engineering, I would recommend Java first because it helps you understand the inner workings of programming as well.
        Although the TIOBE index has shown Java to be a language in decline, it nevertheless remains comfortably at the top of the table. It might have dropped significantly between 2016 and 2017, but more recently its decline has slowed: it has dropped only 0.92% between October 2018 and October 2019.
